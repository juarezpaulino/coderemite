of Magicians (ACM). The trick was so nice it received the ‘Best Magic Award’ at the conference.
The trick requires three participants: the magician himself, a spectator and an assistant. During
the trick the spectator is asked to shuffle a deck of 52 cards and pick randomly 5 cards out of
the deck. The five cards are given to the assistant (without the magician seeing the cards) who
looks at them and shows four of the five cards one by one to the magician. After seeing the
four cards the magician magically guesses the missing fifth card!

<p>The trick works because once the assistant has the five cards he can always choose four of them
and use those to ‘code’ information about the fifth one. The code is based on an ordering of
the cards. Cards are ordered first by their suits and then by their face value. We will use the
following order:

<blockquote>
	<li>H &lt; C &lt; D &lt; S (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades) for suits; and
	<li>1 &lt; 2 &lt; ... &lt; 9 &lt; T &lt; J &lt; Q &lt; K for face values, where T, J, Q and K stand for Ten, Jack, Queen and King, respectively.
</blockquote>

<p>Assume the spectator chose the cards JD, 8S, 7H, 8C, QH (Jack of Diamonds, 8 of Spades, 7
of Hearts, 8 of Clubs and Queen of Hearts). The strategy for the assistant is the following:

<blockquote>
	<li>Find a suit s which appears at least twice in the set of chosen cards (Hearts in the
example). If more than one suit appears two times, choose the one with lowest order.

	<li>Hide the card x with suit s that is at most six positions ahead in the cyclic order 1 &lt;
2 &lt; ... &lt; T &lt; J &lt; Q &lt; K &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; ... of another card y of the same suit. That is
always possible since there are only thirteen cards with the same suit (in the example the
assistant hides QH). If two or more cards satisfy the criteria above, choose the one with
the smallest face value.

	<li>Show y to the magician. At this point the magician knows the suit of the hidden card,
and also knows that the face value of the hidden card x is at most six positions in front
of the face value of y.

	<li>With the three cards the assistant has left, he must code a number between 1 and 6.
That can be done as follows. Say the three cards z1, z2, z3 are in the order z1 < z2 < z3.
Each of six possible orders in which these three cards can be shown may be interpreted
to convey information about a number.

	<blockquote>
		- z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>3</sub> means 1,<br>
		- z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>3</sub>, z<sub>2</sub> means 2,<br>
		- z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>3</sub> means 3,<br>
		- z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>3</sub>, z<sub>1</sub> means 4,<br>
		- z<sub>3</sub>, z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub> means 5,<br>
		- z<sub>3</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, z<sub>1</sub> means 6.
	</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In this way, once the magician is shown the four cards one by one, he has enough information
to “magically” guess the fifth one!

<p>Your job is to develop a program that, given the four cards shown by the assistant, informs the
magician which is the hidden card.

<P>The input contains several test cases. The first line in the input contains an integer N specifying
the number of test cases (1 &le; N &le; 10000). Each test case is composed by one line, which
contains the description of the four cards, separated by a space, in the order they were presented
by the assistant.

<P>For each test case in the input your program must produce one line of output, containing the
description of the hidden card.
