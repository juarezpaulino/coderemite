in building houses for the high-end market. ICPC is planning a housing development for new
homes around a lake. The houses will be built in lots of different sizes, but all lots will be on the
lake shore. Additionally, every lot will have exactly two neighbors in the housing development:
one to the left and one to the right.

<p align=center><img src=p3151a.gif>

<p>ICPC owns the land around the lake and needs to divide it into lots according to the housing
development plan. However, the County Council has a curious regulation regarding land tax,
intended to discourage the creation of small lots:

<blockquote>
	1. land can only be divided using a sequence of land divisions;<br>
	2. a land division is an operation that divides one piece of land into two pieces of land; and<br>
	3. for each land division, a land division tax must be paid.
</blockquote>

<p>Denoting by A the area of the largest resulting part of the division, the value of the land division
tax is A × F, where F is the division tax factor set yearly by the County Council. Note that due
to (2), in order to divide a piece of land into N lots, N - 1 land divisions must be performed,
and therefore N - 1 payments must be made to the County Council.

<p>For example, considering the figure above, if the division tax factor is 2.5 and the first land
division separates the lot of 500 units of area from the other lots, the land division tax to be
paid for this first division is 2.5 × (300 + 200 + 100 + 100 + 100). If the next land division
separates the lot of 300 units together with its neighbor lot of 100 units, from the set of the
remaining lots, an additional 2.5 × (300 + 100) must be paid in taxes, and so on. Note also
that some land divisions are not possible, due to (2). For example, after the first land division
mentioned above, it is not possible to make a land division to separate the lot of 300 units
together with the lot of 200 units from the remaining three lots, because more than two parts
would result from that operation.

<p>Given the areas of all lots around the lake and the current value of the division tax factor, you
must write a program to determine the smallest total land division tax that should be paid to
divide the land according to the housing development plan.

Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<p>The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains an integer N and
a real F, indicating respectively the number of lots (1 &le; N &le; 200) and the land division
tax factor (with precision of two decimal digits, 0 &lt; F &le; 5.00). The second line of a test
case contains N integers X<sub>i</sub>, representing the areas of contiguous lots in the development plan
(0 &lt; X<sub>i</sub> &le; 500, for 1 &le; i &le; N); furthermore, X<sub>k</sub> is neighbour to X<sub>k+1</sub> for 1 &le; k &le; N - 1, and
X<sub>N</sub> is neighbour to X<sub>1</sub>. The end of input is indicated by N = F = 0.

Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>

<P>For each test case in the input your program must produce a single line of output, containing
the minimum total land division tax, as a real number with precision of two decimal digits.
