</p><h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">Common Characteristics</a></h1>
<p>
There are a number of characteristics that are common to these two
problems and to all dynamic programming problems.  These
are:
</p><ol><li> The problem can be divided into <em>stages</em> with a
  <em>decision</em> required at each stage.
<p>
  In the capital budgeting problem the stages were the allocations to a
  single plant.  The decision was how much to spend.  In the shortest
  path problem, they were defined by the structure of the graph.  The
  decision was were to go next.</p></li><li> Each stage has a number of <em>states</em> associated with it.
<p>
  The states for the capital budgeting problem corresponded to the
  amount spent at that point in time.  The states for the shortest path
  problem was the node reached.</p></li><li> The decision at one stage transforms one state into a state in
  the next stage.
<p>
  The decision of how much to spend gave a total amount spent for the
  next stage.  The decision of where to go next defined where you
  arrived in the next stage.</p></li><li> Given the current state, the optimal decision for each of the
  remaining states does not depend on the previous states or decisions.
<p>
  In the budgeting problem, it is not necessary to know how the money
  was spent in previous stages, only how much was spent.  In the path
  problem, it was not necessary to know how you got to a node, only that
  you did.</p></li><li> There exists a recursive relationship that identifies the
  optimal decision for stage <i>j</i>, given that stage <i>j</i>+1 has already
  been solved.</li><li> The final stage must be solvable by itself.
</li></ol>
The last two properties are tied up in the recursive relationships
given above.
<p>
The big skill in dynamic programming, and the art involved, is to take
a problem and determine stages and states so that all of the above
hold.  If you can, then the recursive relationship makes finding the
values relatively easy.  Because of the difficulty in identifying
stages and states, we will do a fair number of examples.
